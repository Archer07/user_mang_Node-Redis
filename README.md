#### Manage'em -alpha
 
 
 This is a simple NodeJs app backed by Redis databse and cahing system. I have built this app to get my hands a little bit dirty with Redis technology and its features.  

 

## Requirements
 * Redis 
 * NodeJS
 * Yarn package manager
 
### Try it

* yarn install
* yarn build 
 
 
 
**_I will be adding features and developing it over time._**
